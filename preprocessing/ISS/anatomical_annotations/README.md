This folder contains representative notebooks for creating virtual H&E images from ISS data, annotating them and transferring the annotations onto the gene expression anndata object:

- `Virtual_H&E_ISS.ipynb`: creation of a the RGB image that serves as a proxy for the missing H&E image in ISS data
- `Anatomical_annotations_ISS.ipynb`: broad (organ-level) anatomical annotations for a representative second trimester sample (17 PCW full female reproductive tract)
- `RostroCaudal_annotations_ISS.ipynb`: landmark anatomical annotations used to construct the MÃ¼llerian rostro-caudal axis for a representative second trimester sample (17 PCW full female reproductive tract)
