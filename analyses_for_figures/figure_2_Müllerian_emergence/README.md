## Figure 2: Ontology, migration and regression of the Müllerian ducts

This directory contains the following scripts 

- `Müllerian_Duct_Emergence.ipynb`: python notebook that performs the sub-analysis for the emerging human Müllerian duct (6-8 PCW). 

- `Müllerian_Duct_Emergence_TradeSeq.ipynb`: R notebook that identifies the temporally variable genes along the three trajectories from the coelomic epithelium to the Müllerian duct epithelium, mesenchyme, and degenerating mesenchyme using [Slingshot](10.1186/s12864-018-4772-0) and [TradeSeq](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-14766-3). 
  
- `Wolffian_to_Müllerian_Signalling_CellPhoneDB_step1.ipynb`: python notebook that prepares the input files to infer cell-cell communication between the developing Wolffian and Müllerian duct cells using [CellPhoneDB v5](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2311.04567).  
  
- `Wolffian_to_Müllerian_Signalling_CellPhoneDB_step2.ipynb`: python notebook that infers cell-cell communication between the developing Wolffian and Müllerian duct cells using [CellPhoneDB v5](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2311.04567).
