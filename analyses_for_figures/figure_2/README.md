## Figure 2: Sexual dimorphism in the genital tubercle

This directory contains the following scripts 

- `Genital_Tubercle_Human_Sexual_Dimorphism.ipynb`: python notebook that performs the sub-analysis for the human genital tubercle scRNA-seq cells during the "masculinisation programming window", spanning from 8 to 14 PCW.

- `Genital_Tubercle_Human_CellPhoneDB.ipynb`: python notebook that identifies sexually dimorphic cell-cell communication events between the corpus spongiosum and urethral epithelium of the human genital tubercle during the "masculinisation programming window". 
  
- `Genital_Tubercle_Mouse_Amato2021_Reanalysis.ipynb`: python notebook that re-analyses the published mouse dataset [Amato et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2103856118) of the differentiating genital tubercle from E14.5, E16.5 and E18.5 male and female samples. 
  
- `Genital_Tubercle_Cross_Species_Prepare_for_Milo.ipynb`: python notebook that prepares the anndata objects of the human and mouse genital tubercles for [Milo](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-01033-z) graph construction. 
  
- `Genital_Tubercle_Human_Milo.ipynb`: R notebook that computes the neighbourhood graph for the human genital tubercle with [Milo](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-01033-z).
  
- `Genital_Tubercle_Mouse_Milo.ipynb`: R notebook that computes the neighbourhood graph for the mouse genital tubercle with [Milo](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-01033-z).

- `Genital_Tubercle_Cross_Species_Nhood_to_Cell_Type_Matching.ipynb`: python notebook that compares the cell type labels associated to the matching neighbourhoods.
