## Figure 6: Regionalisation of the fallopian tube and epididymis occurs during fetal development

This directory contains the following scripts 

- `FallopianTube_Axis_Epithelium_Visium_TradeSeq.ipynb`: notebook that computes spatially variable genes along the fallopian tube axis in 10x Visium female samples > 10 PCW using [TradeSeq](https://github.com/statOmics/tradeSeq)
  
- `Epididymis_Axis_Epithelium_Visium_TradeSeq.ipynb`: notebook that computes spatially variable genes along the epididymal axis in 10x Visium male samples > 10 PCW using [TradeSeq](https://github.com/statOmics/tradeSeq)
  
- `FallopianAxis_Epithelium_Filtering_Spatially_Variable_Genes.ipynb`: notebook that filters the spatially variable genes identified with TradeSeq by comparing their expression in fallopian tube epithelial cells vs every other cell type in the female > 10 PCW dataset.
  
- `EpididymisAxis_Epithelium_Filtering_Spatially_Variable_Genes.ipynb`: notebook that filters the spatially variable genes identified with TradeSeq by comparing their expression in epididymis epithelial cells vs every other cell type in the male > 10 PCW dataset.
  
- `FallopianTube_Fetal_Adult_Comparison.ipynb`: notebook that compares the expression of the spatially variable genes identified in the fetal fallopian tube with a 37 years old fallopian tube sample.
