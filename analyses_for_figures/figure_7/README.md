- `Drug2Cell_Müllerian_Wolffian_epithelia.ipynb`: notebook that applies the [drug2cell](https://github.com/Teichlab/drug2cell) method to identify CHEMBL drugs that could target Müllerian and Wolffian epithelia in samples <= 10 PCW.
  
- `Drug2Cell_Müllerian_derived_epithelia.ipynb`: notebook that applies the [drug2cell](https://github.com/Teichlab/drug2cell) method to identify CHEMBL drugs that could target Müllerian-derived epithelia in female samples > 10 PCW.
  
- `Drug2Cell_Wolffian_derived_epithelia.ipynb`: notebook that applies the [drug2cell](https://github.com/Teichlab/drug2cell) method to identify CHEMBL drugs that could target Wolffian-derived epithelia in male samples > 10 PCW.
  
- `InVivo_InVitro_CellTypist.ipynb`: notebook that uses [CellTypist](https://github.com/Teichlab/celltypist) to transfer epithelial cell type labels from an in vivo 18 PCW female sample and the epithelial organoid sample derived from it.
